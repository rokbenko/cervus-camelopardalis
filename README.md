## About

Hi, I'm Rok! <img src = "./wave.gif" width="20" />

It all started with a 2-hour high school lecture about HTML and CSS. The webpage we made was terrible looking, but the point was to learn the basics. I was curious how to make it aesthetically pleasing, so I started learning HTML and CSS everyday after coming back from school.

~ Passionate about learning technology since then.
